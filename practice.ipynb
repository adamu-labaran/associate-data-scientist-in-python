    "✅ Option 2: \"Flat files consist of multiple tables with structured relationships between the tables.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Explanation:\n",
    "A flat file is a simple data storage format where data is stored in a plain text or binary file without structured relationships between tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why is Option 2 incorrect?\n",
    "Flat files do not support multiple tables or relationships like relational databases (e.g., SQL).\n",

    "✅ Option 3: A record in a flat file is composed of fields or attributes, each of which contains at most one item of information.\n",
    "✔️ True – Each record has fields (or attributes), typically separated by commas (CSV), tabs (TSV), or other delimiters.\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ Option 4: Flat files are pervasive in data science.\n",
    "✔️ True – Data scientists frequently use flat files (CSV, TXT, JSON) to store and process large datasets.\n",

PEP8, for example, is a standard style guide for Python, written by our sensei Guido van Rossum himself. It is the basis for how we here at DataCamp ask our instructors to style their code. Another one of my favorites is PEP20, commonly called the Zen of Python. Its abstract is as follows:\n",
